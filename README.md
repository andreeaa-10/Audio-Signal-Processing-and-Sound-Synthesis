<h1>
  Audio Signal Processing Overview
</h1>
I developed a strong understanding of audio signal processing, covered key concepts such as storing analog signals (stereo and mono), creating artificial sounds using oscillators, visualizing sound,
and applying filters to audio, with a focus on practical applications in music production. I investigated the Fourier transformation and its inverse. Learned how to analyze sound frequencies and
identify harmonic content using Fast Fourier Transformation algorithms.
